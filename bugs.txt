Issues


-You can play victory cards that aren't actions.
-Players cannot see special rules for cards.
-The game log has strange formatting for the card data.
-When buying one Shanty Town, a player gets two of them(This is probably a bug that is not specific
to Shanty Town).
-Curse cards do not show up(For some reason, the Curse.curse object is empty, even after it is
 supposedly created).
 -Sometimes, players start with an empty hand.
