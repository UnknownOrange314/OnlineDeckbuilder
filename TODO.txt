TODO

-Find a way to implement layout without using tables.
    -Layout should look like old layout, but move the game status, and hand info
    to the bottom.
    -CSS supports scaling when hovering over, so we can have
    small text and images for each card that scales when hovering over it.
-Fix cards so that they use terms not from Dominion.
-Fix the interface so that scrolling is not required.
-For chapel,enforce limit on number of cards that can be selected.
-Show the names of empty piles.
-Add information in log to mention durations.
-Show a list of duration cards.
-Add a plus button next to each card to indicate that it can be purchased.
-Hide "Play treasures" button when selecting options for a card.
-Figure out how to display game without scrolling.
